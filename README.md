# Bingo Card Generator 🔮

Prints five columns and five rows of pseudo random numbers to a CSV file for data merge.

Each column follows bingo rules:

**"B" (numbers 1–15)<br>**
**"I" (numbers 16–30)<br>**
**"N" (numbers 31–45)<br>**
**"G" (numbers 46–60)<br>**
**"O" (numbers 61–75)**

There is a “FREE SPACE” located in column “N”, position three. Output is a data merge ready CSV file. Number of cards generated is controlled through prompt. Command line only, no GUI.
